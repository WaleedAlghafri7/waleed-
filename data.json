However, Violet is injured after a mission which resulted in the loss of her arms, requiring them to be replaced with prosthesis. Colonel Hodgins, an old acquaintance of Gilbert, arrives to pick up Violet. He explains to Violet that the war they were fighting has ended and peace has come, though he is unwilling to tell Violet what happened to Gilbert. They leave for the capital city of Leiden, where Gilbert had already arranged for Violet to be adopted by the Evergarden family. However, Violet cannot adjust to civilian life due to her military indoctrination. Hodgins then decides to show Violet his business, the CH postal company which acts as a private mail and ghostwriting service and hires her as a postal worker. She then witnesses the Auto Memoir Dolls of the ghostwriting department writing a letter for an illiterate man who wants to proclaim his love to someone. Violet then remembers that \"I love you\" were the last words Gilbert had told her. Wanting to know the meaning of the words, Violet asks Hodgins for her to join the ghostwriting department. Impressed that Violet has finally shown signs of acting on her own free will instead of on someone else's orders, Hodgins accepts Violet's request despite her not being an Auto Memoir Doll.",

Under Cattelya's direction, Violet begins her training as an Auto Memoir Doll, quickly learning how to use a typewriter. However, despite her technical proficiency, Violet is still incapable of understanding emotions. This comes to a head when she offers to write a romantic letter that ends up angering both the recipient and the client. Erica then confronts Violet about her motivations to become a Doll, but relents when Violet tells her about her desire to learn the meaning of the words \"I love you.\" Iris suggests to Hodgins to fire Violet, but Erica comes to her defense, partly motivated due to her own insecurities about being a proper Doll. Hodgins decides not to fire Violet and gives her a new uniform, along with the brooch Gilbert had originally given to Violet, which Hodgins managed to recover. Violet is overjoyed at the return of the brooch, and agrees to attend a Doll training course. That night, Hodgins confides in Cattleya that he used to be friends with Gilbert, and that Gilbert is \"never coming back\".",
